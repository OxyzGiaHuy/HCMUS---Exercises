# HCMUS C++ Journey
This is where I document my journey through the trials of learning C++ at HCMUS. The main topics covered include:
- **Recursive Problems**: Solutions for classic problems like Tower of Hanoi, N Queens, and Knight's Tour.
- **Dynamic Programming** (with result retrieval): Coin Change, Longest Increasing Subsequences, Prime Expressions.
- **Matrix Operations**: Matrix multiplication using pointers.
- **Linked List Review**: Implementations of Linked List, Stack, and Queue structures.
